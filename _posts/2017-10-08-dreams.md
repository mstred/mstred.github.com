> The problem with dreams is they tend to vanish when you wake up...

-- [Alvaro Videla][1]

It's been a while (two years have gone so fast) since I posted something here. Soon as I've read the sentence above in
[this wonderful article][2], motivation came like sunshine.

A lot of things have happened and others haven't as well. But one thing I've found to be certain: you need to keep dreaming
while the life doesn't come rushing to wake you up.
