_In a chain of characters I put my insights and let my creativity flow..._

A complex composition of encoded data which, attached, may burst an explosion of
thoughts on the wire. Wired up, by the way, in the real essence of a line that
goes from point A to B.

String data attributes have been a staple in the life of a coder, where it
enabled him to describe his work in a wonderful way, so that others could
appreciate and understand what that bunch of code was purposed for.

After all, strings are intended to define the presentation of something... to
describe something actually `"readable"`.
