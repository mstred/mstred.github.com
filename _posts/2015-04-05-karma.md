Cause and effect. Destiny and fate. We are designers of our own future, but does
this make a clear definition of what we are really going to go through?
[Last week I discussed][1] about the airplane disaster incident that happened
and this came as an insight to talk about the journeys we have to go along.


Today I bring this up again to comment on the [tragic fate that occured for many
Kenyan students][2]. A clash on religions turned that into a fact which sadly
came to be the reality for that people. Some time ago I saw a tweet that caught
my attention:


<section>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>Religion in a nutshell <a href="http://t.co/ewPJC1PKzK">pic.twitter.com/ewPJC1PKzK</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/537010861919830016">November 24, 2014</a></blockquote>

I am not bragging to say that religion is the real monster, but I think that
people misunderstands the actual motivation behind that.


Faith in a common good is one thing that should be amongst any other. Right
next to it, religion should be represented as a catalyst for peace, where
mankind could find this as a relief or a shelf in a world of greed and
indifference. But karma keeps going on and on in the face of humanity and we
still keep asking why.
