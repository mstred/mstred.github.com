...and winter has come.

No one was asking for it, but just came like a brutal horde of savages
storming from the north.

Huge drops of rain falls down to the earth while a thunderstorm crack up the
sky into pieces.

Pieces of sadness and bitterness, fragments of devastation and loss. Nature
ravages to claim its equilibrium, while men keep on exploiting it more and more.

It's time to rethink and reflect about our decisions and positions on the things
which we're involved.

We have to go through the winter in our lives, rebuild ourselves and do the
best to be ready and enjoy the next summer.
