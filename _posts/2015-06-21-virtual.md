Trying to understand what goes behind the monitor screen was exactly the
fascination which described my earliest interest in information technology.

I can barely remember how this happened, some time ago. Late 90's... people
were frightened by the threat of the [Y2K Problem][1] and some even were afraid
[the world was going to end][2]. Thankfully, none of that occurred and so here
we are.

Back to my history, that was when I actually interacted with a computer for the
first time. It was in a [personal computer][3] (that kind of all white box
computers) at school, fueled by Windows 95 (even with Windows 98 out to market).
To have a computer in such time was a privilege to a few ones and that clunky
box was the only one at that place.

I didn't have a clue on how that machine worked and, as a monitor could resemble
a TV display, it hasn't impressed me enough when turned off. But right after
boot up, it was such an incredible experience. The magic of software made my
eyes shine bright. The first app I started was a [classic minesweeper game][4]
and even for a simple program, it was amazing to see what that device could do.

A representation of a virtual and wonderful universe has actually presented to
me in that moment. Something that has changed my life definitely.
