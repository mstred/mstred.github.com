Nothing like regex to express some kind of _artsy thought_.

Because exactly as it sounds and seems, _past_ events may determine what happens
next... and _post_-action results are defined as a consequence of what have been
made.

Just a chronological gap between the magic of words differed by a single letter.

```/p(a|o)st/i.test('past');```
<br>
```/p(a|o)st/i.test('post');```

...and time is just a fine thread, regular-expressioned over.
