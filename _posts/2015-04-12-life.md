As the great Sinatra sang in these wise verses, [that's life][1].


A confusing cycle between moments of joy and sadness. Sometimes it's a sunny
day and with a blink of the eye, it goes to a dark and stormy weather.


It's quite obvious that there's good and bad days, but who ever knows what will come for tomorrow?
It's a matter of being hopeful and keep doing the best to make it brighter, even
if the struggle it's hard as it seems to be.


Keep it strong and carry on.
