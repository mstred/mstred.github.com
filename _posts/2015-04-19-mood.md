Everyday I try to make something good and work on pleasant things. Sometimes
it doesn't work quite as expected and surely, this comes to pull me down.
This is the moment when the mood gets bad out of the blue.

Right after that, I go through the steps below, trying to make a turn:

1. Take a deep breath of fresh air
2. Drink a glass of cold water
3. Put headphones on (over ear are way better)
4. Start a great freaking playlist

I think this worked well with me someday and I'll make it as my personal recipe
for "instant feelgood mood boostering™". This may seem to be so '_cliché_' in terms
of getting things right, but moods actually make a difference.

[_...but, do you know that sometimes bad moods are not so bad?_][1]

Yes, I think I've got to deal with it.
