Is a certain activity valuable enough for someone to apply his or her efforts
into it?

People got to work on something and this is a real condition for life
sustainability. Lack of motivation, however, comes along and imposes barriers
which may blow up every step built up from a mindset moved toward a realization
of a dream.

They go along, taking time, to find a reason to keep holding on until
realize the result of that effort. The satisfaction of getting the return from a
hard work is speechless. Grateful. And most of all, uplifting. It keeps anyone
getting stronger, as it was enable to break through all the stones in the middle
of the road.

When times are tough, remember that each step you take will lead you forward.
Either running, walking or even crawling, you got to work until the yield comes
on.
