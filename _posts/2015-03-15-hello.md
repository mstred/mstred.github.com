Oh, hi. It's me, [@mstred].

I'm a software developer who lives in the metropolitan district of [Recife], a place well-known for its [beaches] and [carnival]
and also many other [funny things].

Jokes apart, we got a very cool way of live and work here, being home for one of the most important
high tech centers in Brazil (even [worldwide]). Being part of that really makes me feel proud and it's a huge motivation to
transcript my feelings over here.

I was wondering for some time ago if I'd really put my brain to work right on this and finally, with a mindset change and a life
replanning, I decided to stop and write down a <s>daily</s> (whoa, weekly should be better...) weekly journal of what happened
(or could happen) to me. This includes stories based on life challenges, learning new things and reflections upon random facts.

I hope it'll work just fine.
