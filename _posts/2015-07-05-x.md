x is the answer we always hoped to find. It has a remarkable presence in
mathematical expressions such as equations and function definitions.

x, in roman numerals, represents the tenth number.

x is also used as a symbol for represent a "cancel" operation or "wrong" choice
as an error in feedback messages, concerning user interface guidelines.

x may be a check mark usually applied into ballot boxes in test exams and forms,
also known as the _x mark_.

x, in english, is also used as a contraction to reduce words into simple
expressions, like _x-ray_, _x-men_, _xp_ (experience in most adventure and
role-playing games) and even "_xing_", which means crossing, in many road signs.

x... such a simple letter which brings a lot of meanings with it.
