There are times that we stop to think about everything we have done until the
actual moment. Just like a reflection about what path you have chosen to follow
along your life.


This is happening to me, as I ask myself everyday (or maybe everytime) if I'm
actually doing the right thing. Recently I went to a place and there I made a
still image that will always be in my memory when I leave my mind for these
deep thoughts:

I hope this picture can bring good vibrations for this brand new week. See ya!
