I've been off since the last post I [actually made here][1]. Back from a
[sick time][2] and a weird week, I missed the time and the chance to write down
what's happening and here I am again. I'm trying hard to get along with this.

But the last week has been actually great towards the tech _reservoir_, with
announcements from [Microsoft][3] and [Tesla][4], for instance.

From the Tesla's side, a device to storage electric power, bringing a new
perspective on integration with suppliers, such as standard providers or
even self-sustainable solar cells. The key here is where is lies upon: smart
households and home automation focused in energy efficiency.

Right to the Redmond's headquarters' big player, we had some updates from many
things they are up to release this year. With a burst of innovation (and a lot
of heads turning), it's coming a new operating system which claims to bring a
true seamless experience through the consumer gadgets, from smartphones to
convertibles and even their game console. Along with it, an "edge"-driven web
browser initiative (will they actually kill the IE haunting ghost?) and a
virtual reality user interface. They even announced a lightweight edition for
their [code editor][5] (which seems to be pretty cool... crossplatform, btw).

Yes, this really got me "on" again... and I didn't even mean to have enough
content to talk about, but that's it. Hope the best for this next week.
